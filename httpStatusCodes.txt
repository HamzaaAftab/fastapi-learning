HTTP Status codes are 3 digit numbers returned by a web server like (FastAPI) to indicate the result of a client's request (like from a browser or API consumer)...

They help the client (browser, frontend, mobile app etc) to understand:
-- whether the request was successful
-- whether something went wrong
-- and what kind of issue occured if any

2xx -> Successful
3xx -> Redirection
4xx -> Client Error
5xx -> Server Error
